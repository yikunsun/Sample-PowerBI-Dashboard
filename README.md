# Interactive Power BI Dashboard to Visualize Sales Data
**Power BI comes in handy as we develop business intelligence. The goal of this interactive dashboard is to analyze revenue on a yearly basis by category of products, manufacturer 
along with their location, and so on, also how revenue grows year to year.**

**This dashboard has 2 filters on the top left corner, date and manufacturer. We can filter date by using the slicer and manufacturer by simply clicking on the logo. Below
the  filters, we are able to check revenue by category of products on "Revenue by Category" chart, where we can clearly tell Urban is the most popular category among 4 categories.
Under this chart, "Revenue and % Growth by Country and Manufacturer (groups)" tells a very good story on where we make most revenue by which manufacturer group, also % growth
of revenue for each country compared to the previous year.**

**On the right hand side, "Revenue and % Growth by Year and Manufacturer (groups)" gives us a detailed illustration of revenue brought by each manufacturer group yearly 
between 2013 and 2018, also the growth rate of revenue year over year. Below this chart, "Revenue and PY Sales" compares current year revenue to the previous year, which tells
us how we perform against last year.**

**I'm attaching both the PDF report and the PBIT file here, where there are numerous amazing interactive features, please try to play with it and see how charts correlate to 
each other!**

Thank you!
